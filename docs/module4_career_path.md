# Module 4: Career Path Visualization

## Core Functionality

This module provides users with interactive visualizations of potential career trajectories based on their current skills and career goals, enabling them to understand skill relationships, explore possible career paths, and make informed decisions about professional development.

## Technical Components

### 1. Skill Graph Visualization

- **Skill Relationship Mapping**:
  - Force-directed graph visualization of interconnected skills
  - Clustering of related skills into domain groups
  - Visual differentiation of current vs. adjacent skills
  - Strength indicators for skill relationships
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Zoom and pan capabilities
  - Skill node selection for detailed information
  - Filtering options by skill category
  - Highlight paths between selected skills
- **Visualization Technology**:
  - D3.js for interactive graph rendering
  - Canvas-based rendering for performance with large graphs
  - WebGL acceleration for complex visualizations

### 2. Career Trajectory Projection

- **Path Visualization**:
  - Timeline-based career progression visualization
  - Multiple potential paths from current position
  - Role transition visualization with skill requirements
  - Salary and demand trends along paths
- **Career Role Nodes**:
  - Current and potential future roles
  - Skill requirements for each role
  - Time estimates for transitions
  - Market demand indicators
- **Progression Metrics**:
  - Skill gap analysis for each career transition
  - Difficulty assessment for path segments
  - Estimated timeline for progression
  - Salary progression projections

### 3. "What-If" Scenario Modeling

- **Simulation Capabilities**:
  - Skill acquisition impact analysis
  - Career pivot exploration
  - Industry transition evaluation
  - Education and certification ROI assessment
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Skill addition/removal toggles
  - Timeline adjustment sliders
  - Priority weighting controls
  - Geographical filter options
- **Outcome Visualization**:
  - Before/after career path comparison
  - Changed opportunity access
  - Timeline impacts
  - Salary potential changes

### 4. Development Recommendations

- **Skill Development Suggestions**:
  - Prioritized skill acquisition recommendations
  - Learning resource suggestions
  - Time investment estimates
  - Impact predictions for each skill
- **Education & Certification Guidance**:
  - Relevant course and certification suggestions

  - Time commitment estimates
  - Success rate statistics
- **Customized Learning Plans**:
  - Sequenced skill acquisition roadmaps
  - Milestone tracking
  - Time-based learning schedules
  - Progress assessment methods

## Implementation Approach

### Data Flow

- Receive user skill profile from Module 1
- Get job market data from Module 2
- Generate skill graph and career path options
- Create interactive visualizations for frontend
- Process user inputs for "what-if" scenarios
- Update visualizations with new projections

### Algorithms & Models

- **Skill Relationship Modeling**: Graph-based algorithms for connectivity analysis
- **Career Path Generation**: Sequence prediction using historical progression data
- **Timeline Estimation**: Regression models based on skill acquisition patterns
- **Recommendation Ranking**: Multi-factor scoring model for skill suggestions
